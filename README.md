Install Node.js and npm on your system if they are not already installed. You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the Angular application.

Clone the repository of the Angular application from GitHub using the following command:

# git clone <repository_url>

Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the GitHub repository you want to clone.

Navigate to the cloned repository using the following command:

# cd <repository_name>

Replace <repository_name> with the name of the cloned repository.

Install the dependencies required to run the application using the following command:

# npm install

Once the dependencies are installed successfully, you can start the Angular application using the following command:

# ng serve

Wait for a few seconds until the Angular application is compiled and starts running. Once it's done, you should see a message in the command prompt or terminal saying something like "Compiled successfully" and "Local: http://localhost:4200".

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL http://localhost:4200. You should see the Angular application running on your local machine.
